Some issues may appear if you compile the thesis in your own latex environment, mainly regarding the layout. I recommend you to use the overleaf version: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/arcada-bda-thesis-template/

Steps:
1. pdflatex 0-Arcada_Thesis.tex
2. bibtex 0-Arcada_Thesis.aux
3. pdflatex 0-Arcada_Thesis.tex

Run the same steps until you see your bibliography. Check the pages to see how to cite and create automatically your bibliography.
